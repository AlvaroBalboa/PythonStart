print(40*30*0.5)
#lets learn about the exponent sign whi is the ** character sequence

print(2**5)

# this is known as a bianary operator


# now to talk about division

print(2/4)
# answer is 0.5

print(23/5)
# answer is 4.6
# in older values this would of returned 4 not 4.6

# this is the floor division operator
print(23//5)
# this answer is 4
# even with a 23.0 it will still round to the nearest whole number the answer here would be 4.0 not the expected 4.6

# now to talk about the modulo math
print(25%4)
# answer is 1
